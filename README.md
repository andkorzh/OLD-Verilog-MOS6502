# OLD-Verilog-MOS6502

Back in 2012, at the dawn of the MOS6502 reverse, Ogamespec wrote a verilog. 
All these years, I never got around to testing it in action. 
It had big problems with the operability of the lower part of the processor 
and I had to replace the lower part with my ready-made 6502 modules. 
The project turned out to be working and was tested as part of the FPGA APU 2A03. 
It is slightly different in writing style from my verilog cores.

Some photo reports on the work done:
